# Stepping Stones - Readme
This repository includes source code and assets for my compo entry for the 42th edition of Ludum Dare.

## Objective
Reach the other side of each level! Consider each step carefully so you don't loose your footing :D

## Controls
* WASD or Arrow keys to move. 
    Movement is free on the safe areas, but it goes one step at a time the moment you step on a pillar.
* M to toggle sound on/off
* R to restart the current level
* T to restart from the first level

## Tech
* Haxeflixel + Flash develop as implementation language/library/IDE of choice
* Aseprite + some Photoshop for assets
* Labchirp, Caustic, Bfxr and Jfxr for sounds. No time for music once again :sob: 
* HackNPlan for...planning
